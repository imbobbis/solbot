## 🏗 Architecture

SolBot consists of five key services:

1. **`solana-bot-telegram`** – Telegram bot interface.
2. **`solana-bot-admin`** – Admin UI for managing bot settings.
3. **`solana-bot-api`** – Backend logic for trade execution.
4. **`solana-bot-db`** – Database for storing settings and trade data.
5. **`solana-bot-queue`** – Redis/RabbitMQ for task queuing.

Each service runs in a separate container for modular scalability.
